# Pytest execution

## Mandatory

- Run pytest only outside the Codex Windows sandbox.
- Request out-of-sandbox execution before the first pytest run; do not try it in the sandbox first.
- If out-of-sandbox execution is unavailable or denied, do not run pytest; report it instead.
- NEVER change pytest temp-directory settings or test code merely to work around sandbox permission errors.

## Command

- Use `uv run -m pytest` for the full test suite.
- Use `uv run -m pytest <test-path>` for a targeted test.
